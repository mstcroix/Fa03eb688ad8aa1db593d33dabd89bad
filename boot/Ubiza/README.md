## Polisystem
### What is a collaborative Poli-space and Poli Operating System (Polisystem)?

"At Thingsquare, we use a lightweight technique to collect crash reports from devices:

    For every build that is uploaded to devices, the ELF binary is stored and tagged with the git commit ID for that build.
    If a device crashes, the program counter at the time of the crash is stored in non-volatile memory.
    When the device reboots after the crash, the commit ID and program counter at the crash site is reported to the backend."

#### Crash re-synch strategy
nodes are exact copies
<pre>pseudo-code
    :on_crash
        mve pc, ubiza state    ;load program counter with current sol position
</pre>
at boot time, if a crash is detected, the last known valid state is recover, synchronised (as in blockchain) and continue from it.
Handling the whole as a SoS makes possible to update the
