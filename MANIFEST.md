## MANIFESTO for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
>***Individuals and interactions*** over processes and tools<br>
***Working software*** over comprehensive documentation<br>
***Customer collaboration*** over contract negotiation<br>
***Responding to change*** over following a plan
