2030. IoT bees are launched (small battery consumption, solar powered, wireless, over the air updates possible, uIPv4). 2030's computers, or better said, machines running collaborative operating systems (and protocols) will navitevly speak URI, M>D5, escaped 16-bit UNICODE (emoji) and many old-timer 8-bit comebacks.
- Interactions in the www (web2) and web3 space are no longer human-human or human-machine interactions but also machine-machine.
- Groups and Clusters (i.e. Communities) are created automously by machines (i.e. Hives) 
2032. **web4** : 4th generation is born. The first collaborative web4 is a sApp (synchronised App) implemented as a true syncrhronous distributed Forth program as in:
      >dup ( n -- n n )
      >see [[1](https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/)] Forth Language
      >
      >`#me`: Can you help me design a game concept that teaches basic programming skills? Start by asking me which programming language I'd like to focus on.
      >The initial conceptual idea is: _"a (distributed) multi player ping pong with douplets (two against two) including audience (observers)"_
