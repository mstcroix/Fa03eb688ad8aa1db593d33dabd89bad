### Synchronisation
But before going deep into what Synchronisation in a "synchronous SoS System" means.
Lets understand what that means.

Syn|chronos:
- syn- from Greek "together" 
- khronos- "time"

= literally: "time together", meaning, according to Etymonline "recurring at he same successive instant of time"

### Time
Now, what is time?

>Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity states that time is relative, meaning that the rate at which time passes depends on the observer's frame of reference.
>This means that different observers may not agree on when an event happened or how long it took.
>For example, time may pass more slowly for an observer moving at the speed of light, and more quickly for an observer moving more slowly.
>Time also moves differently for objects in motion than for objects at rest.

Synchronously : "simultaneous", "happening at the same time"
--> not realistic, not possible to implement

Rendezvous, from French **rendez-vous** a "place appointed for assembling of troops"
Command: imperative (action): "present yourself", with a more general sense of "appointed place (& common time) of meeting" or "a meeting held by appointment (at an specific time)"

keyword: to ajust, ending (time), to match

#### Time arithmetic : units and multiples

Time: Base 12
1 minute
1 periods = 12 minutes
1 hour = 5 periods * 12 minutes = 60 minutes

Days: 
1 day = 2 phases (darker, lighter) * 12 hours = 24 hours = 1440 minutes or 120 periods per day (m periods darker & n periods lighter, where n + m = 120).

#### Gregorian Calendar vs Maya Calendar & Hebrew concept of day change
_Gregorian_: inexact 365 days, 12 months.

_Maya_: exact 260 days, 13 Moon/28-day calendar.

A cheap implementation for memory + battery constraint (8-bit and 16-bit IoT machines) reduces the need of explicit synchronisation 
(via exchange of data in the network) and ensures corrective action if needed (i.e. onError:timeDoNotMatch)
