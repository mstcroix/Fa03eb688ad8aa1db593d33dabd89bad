2030. Future computers, or better said, machines running collaborative operating systems (and protocols) will navitevly speak URI, M>D5, escaped 16-bit UNICODE (emoji) and many old-timer 8-bit comebacks. IoT bees are launched (small battery consumption, solar powered, wireless, over the air updates possible, uIPv4).
2031. **web4** : 4th generation is born. The first collaborative web4 is a sApp (synchronised App) implemented as a true syncrhronous distributed Forth program as in:
      >dup ( n -- n n )
      >see [[1](https://skilldrick.github.io/easyforth/)] Forth Language
      >
      >`#me`: Can you help me design a game concept that teaches basic programming skills? Start by asking me which programming language I'd like to focus on.
      >The initial conceptual idea is: _"a (distributed) multi player ping pong with douplets (two against two) including audience (observers)"_
